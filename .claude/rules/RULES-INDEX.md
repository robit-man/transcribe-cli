## Core Rules (9 rules — always active)

Core rules are non-negotiable defaults deployed to every AIWG installation.

### CRITICAL

#### no-attribution
**Summary**: AI tools are tools — never add attribution to commits, PRs, docs, or code. No "Co-Authored-By", no "Generated with", no tool branding. This is universal across all 8 providers.
**When to apply**: Commit creation, PR drafting, code generation, documentation output
**Full rule**: @agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/no-attribution.md

#### token-security
**Summary**: Never hard-code tokens, pass tokens as CLI arguments, echo token values, or commit tokens to git. Use the heredoc pattern for scoped token lifetime. File permissions mode 600. Load at point of use.
**When to apply**: API integration, authentication code, command implementation, security review
**Full rule**: @agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/token-security.md

#### versioning
**Summary**: CalVer format: YYYY.M.PATCH with NO leading zeros. npm rejects leading zeros — users can install but cannot update. Tags use `v` prefix (e.g., `v2026.1.5`).
**When to apply**: Version bumps, release tagging, changelog updates, npm publishing, package.json edits
**Full rule**: @agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/versioning.md

#### citation-policy

**Full rule**: @agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/rules/citation-policy.md

### HIGH
