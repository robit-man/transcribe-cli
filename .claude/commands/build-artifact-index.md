# Build Artifact Index (SDLC)

## Task

Walk the specified artifacts folder, extract titles and short summaries, and write digest Markdown files to support
compact agent context. If an `_index.yaml` exists, update summaries and timestamps; otherwise, create a minimal one.

## Outputs

- `digests/*.md` with 1–3 paragraph summaries
- `_index.yaml` updated with paths, summaries, and timestamps

## Notes

- Keep digests short and specific to reduce context size
