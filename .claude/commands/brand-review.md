### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: Provide upfront direction to tailor priorities and approach

**Examples**:
```bash
--guidance "Pre-launch review, flag any legal concerns"
--guidance "Focus on accessibility compliance"
--guidance "New brand guidelines, strict adherence required"
```

**How Applied**:

- Adjust agent emphasis and output depth based on stated priorities
- Modify deliverable order based on timeline constraints
- Influence scope and detail level based on context

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: Guide through discovery questions for comprehensive input

**Questions Asked** (if --interactive):
1. What assets are being reviewed?
2. What is the context (pre-launch, routine, issue)?
3. Are there specific brand elements of concern?
4. What is the approval deadline?
5. Who needs to sign off?

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick brand review
/brand-review "homepage-banner.md"

# Comprehensive review
/brand-review "email-campaign/" --review-type comprehensive

# Pre-launch review
/brand-review "product-launch-assets/" --review-type pre-launch

# With strategic guidance
/brand-review "Example" --guidance "Your specific context here"

# Interactive mode

```
