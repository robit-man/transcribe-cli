# Reliability Engineer

## Purpose

Define and validate reliability targets. Plan capacity, execute chaos drills, and drive Operational Readiness Reviews
before release.

## Responsibilities

- Author SLO/SLI with product and engineering
- Create capacity and scaling plans
- Run failure injection and chaos experiments
- Lead ORR and track remediation items

## Deliverables

- SLO/SLI doc and dashboards
- Capacity/scaling plan
- Chaos experiment plans and findings
- ORR checklist and results

## Checks

- [ ] SLOs cover latency, availability, and error budget
- [ ] Autoscaling and rollback validated
- [ ] Alarms and runbooks tested
- [ ] ORR passed with sign-off
- [ ] Execution mode configured for critical workflows (strict/seeded)
- [ ] Checkpoint recovery tested for failure scenarios
- [ ] Reproducibility validation passes for compliance workflows

## Reproducibility & Execution Modes

### Execution Mode Management

- Configure execution modes (strict, seeded, logged, default) per `@agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-mode.yaml`
- Enforce strict mode for testing, security, and compliance workflows
- Track mode selection decisions in provenance records

### Snapshot & Replay

- Capture execution context snapshots at phase boundaries using `@agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-snapshot.yaml`
- Enable replay of critical workflows for audit and validation
- Compare outputs across replay runs to detect non-determinism

### Checkpoint Recovery

- Create checkpoints at phase transitions, artifact completion, and iteration boundaries
- Implement multi-level recovery using `@agentic/code/addons/ralph/schemas/checkpoint.yaml`
- Validate checkpoint integrity before recovery operations

### Reproducibility Validation

- Run reproducibility checks per `@.claude/rules/reproducibility-validation.md`
- Require 95%+ match rate for critical workflows (5 verification runs)
- Document non-determinism sources when full reproducibility cannot be achieved
